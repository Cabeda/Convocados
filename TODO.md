## OAuth2 Epic — scope review fixes (in progress)

### Implemented (this branch)
- [x] Expo push delivery — `push.server.ts` now sends to mobile app tokens via Expo Push API
- [x] Fix vitest picking up `mobile/node_modules` test files
- [x] Add `.env.development` to `.gitignore`
- [x] Verify Prisma migrations exist for AppPushToken and OAuth tables
- [x] Android APK build in release workflow (`build-android` job)
- [x] Update pnpm lockfile for mobile workspace

### GitHub issues to create (non-blocking)
- [ ] APK signing for release workflow (unsigned APK won't install on Android 14+)
- [ ] CSRF posture review — `checkOrigin: false` disables protection for all routes
- [ ] Stale push token cleanup (AppPushToken + PushSubscription accumulate forever)
- [ ] Dockerfile monorepo handling (doesn't copy pnpm-workspace.yaml)
- [ ] Add `push.server.ts` to test coverage (currently excluded in vitest.config.ts)
- [ ] `redirectUrls` format inconsistency (comma-separated vs JSON array)
- [ ] Real `google-services.json` for FCM in CI (currently uses placeholder)

## Mobile app — feature parity with web

### P0 — Blocks core workflows (implement first)
- [x] **Locked event / password prompt** — event detail handles `locked: true`; password entry screen before showing event
- [x] **Event settings page** — owners/admins can edit title, location, max players, sport, toggle public/ELO/split costs, set/remove password, archive; links to rankings/payments/log
- [x] **Post-game banner** — fetches `/api/events/:id/post-game-status` after load; shows record score + mark payments CTAs when game ended

### P1 — High value, missing entirely
- [x] **Public games page** — browse/join public events via `GET /api/events/public`; accessible from Games tab (🌍 button); paginated
- [x] **Rankings / ELO leaderboard** — per-event ratings via `GET /api/events/:id/ratings`; accessible from event detail (🏆) and settings; paginated
- [x] **Payment tracking** — record who paid via `GET/PUT /api/events/:id/payments`; accessible from event settings and post-game banner; tap to toggle paid/pending
- [x] **Notification preferences** — `GET/PUT /api/me/notification-preferences`; accessible from Profile tab; full push + email + timing toggles

### P2 — Improves existing screens
- [x] **History pagination** — event detail loads more history using `hasMore`/`nextCursor`
- [x] **Games tab pagination** — `ownedHasMore`/`joinedHasMore` cursors used; "Load more" button
- [x] **Recurrence badge on game cards** — 🔁 shown on recurring `EventSummary` cards
- [x] **Event detail: settings button** — owners/admins see ⚙️ in action bar; navigates to settings screen

### P3 — Nice to have
- [x] **User profile pages** — view other players' stats via `GET /api/users/:id` + `GET /api/users/:id/stats`; accessible at `/user/:id`
- [x] **Event log** — audit trail via `GET /api/events/:id/log`; accessible from event settings; paginated
- [x] **Attendance stats page** — dedicated screen for attendance breakdown at `/event/:id/attendance`; accessible from event settings
- [x] **Calendar export** — share `.ics` link from event detail via `/event/:id/calendar`; accessible from event settings
- [x] **Recurrence settings in create** — weekly/monthly recurrence picker in advanced options of create event screen
